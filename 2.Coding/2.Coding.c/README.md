Write a program to create a scatter plot of Theoretical vs. Experimental values from a file (graphnums.tab), and draw a straight line on the plot that would represent a perfect match. Colour the dots by category listed in each line. Show your code and results.

Result

The script Grapher.R will read the values from the input file graphnums.tab and export the required figure to graphnums.png

The result from running Grapher.R is also included here as graphnums.png
